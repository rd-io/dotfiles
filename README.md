# Dotfiles
---
My curated dotfiles. At the time of this README, there are only two configuraitons.

### Neovim
While Neovim is my favorite extensible text editor, I did not want to download someone else's configuration.
While Lazy is the package manager I use, my Neovim configuration is not made from Kickstart or LazyVim.

Rather I use Neovim, and when I find myself wanting a tool to make using the editor easier, I then
look for plugins, and configure those plugins to my liking.

Neovim is found here: https://github.com/neovim/neovim

### Alacritty
The terminal emulator. I like minimalism, and this terminal does what I need. When the Cosmic Terminal reaches
a stable release, I may switch to it. For now, this is my preferred configuration.
